## Background

One day I was checking [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/) dashboard I noticed that one of the endpoints we were using
to deliver new versions has huge bandwidth spikes.

Each new version we released was automatically downloaded by thousands of clients, resulting in terra bytes of egress
costs to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

At the current rate this was around [3,000$/month](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/S3).

Furthermore, our plan was to move to a daily release, which will make this problem even worse and jump
to [~50,000$/month](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/S3).

I immediately tried to think how to resolve this issue.

## Researching a solution

Since all the content we deliver on a new update is identical copies of the same new version, caching jumped into mind.

But unfortunately [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) costs weren't much better at
around [2,500$/month](https://calculator.aws/#/createCalculator/CloudFront).

Being a big fan of [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com/) I knew
of [R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) and
quickly [calculated](https://www.cloudflare.com/pg-cloudflare-r2-vs-aws-s3/#htmlIdPlansMatrix) that
using [R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) will reduce the costs to effectively zero.

## Results

Implementing this was quite easy, simply store and serve from [R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/)
instead of [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Costs reduced to effectively zero.

Another bonus was faster download speed.
